This project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using a potentiometer connected to an ESP8266 development board (such as NodeMCU or Wemos D1 Mini). As the potentiometer is turned, the servo angle changes accordingly from 0° to 180°.

📷 Overview
A servo motor is connected to a digital pin (D4).

A potentiometer is connected to analog pin (A0).

The ESP8266 reads analog values from the potentiometer and maps them to servo angles.

Real-time values are also printed on the Serial Monitor for debugging.

🔧 Hardware Required
ESP8266 (NodeMCU / Wemos D1 Mini)

Servo motor (e.g., SG90)

Potentiometer (10kΩ recommended)

Jumper wires

Breadboard

USB cable for programming

🔌 Circuit Connections
Component	ESP8266 Pin
Servo Signal	D4 (GPIO2)
Servo VCC	3V3
Servo GND	GND
Potentiometer VCC	3V3
Potentiometer GND	GND
Potentiometer Output	A0

🧠 How It Works
The ESP8266 reads the analog input from the potentiometer (range: 0–1023).

It maps this value to a range suitable for servo rotation (0–180 degrees).

It sends this angle to the servo motor using the Servo library.

The position is updated in real-time as the potentiometer is rotated.

Values are displayed in the Serial Monitor at 115200 baud.

🛠️ Notes
Ensure your servo motor does not draw more current than the ESP8266 can supply. For higher-torque servos, consider an external power source.

You may need to install the ESP8266 board support in the Arduino IDE if not already done.
